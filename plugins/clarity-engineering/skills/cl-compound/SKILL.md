# Clarity Compound

Use this skill after meaningful work completes, especially when something worked, failed, surprised the team, or revealed reusable learning.

## Goal

Decide whether the system should learn.

## Inputs

- Completed work summary.
- Decisions made.
- Surprises, failures, bugs, review comments, or repeated patterns.
- Existing docs/templates/skills/tests that might need updating.

## Output

Always include a compounding decision:

- `codify learning` — reusable learning exists and should be captured; or
- `no reusable learning` — nothing should be codified now.

If codifying, include:

- learning summary;
- where it should live: note, checklist, prompt, skill, doc, ADR, test helper, or follow-up ticket;
- concrete update or draft text;
- owner / next action when relevant.

Also include Compound progress status:

- `Done` — learning reviewed, decision made, and codification target or no-op rationale captured.
- `Left` — missing learning context, target location, owner, draft text, or follow-up action.
- `Blocked` — the single focused question needed to finish Compound, if any.
- `Lifecycle complete?` — yes/no, with the reason.

## Rules

- Compound is decision-based, not automatic documentation churn.
- Prefer small reusable updates over large process documents.
- Do not codify private or one-off context unless it changes future behavior.
- Ask one focused question if the reuse value or target location is unclear.
